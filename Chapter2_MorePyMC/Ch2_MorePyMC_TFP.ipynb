    "### TensorFlow Graph and Eager Modes\n",
    "\n",
    "TFP accomplishes most of its heavy lifting via the main `tensorflow` library. The `tensorflow` library also contains many of the familiar computational elements of NumPy and uses similar notation. While NumPy directly executes computations (e.g. when you run `a + b`), `tensorflow` in graph mode instead builds up a \"compute graph\" that tracks that you want to perform the `+` operation on the elements `a` and `b`. Only when you evaluate a `tensorflow` expression  does the computation take place--`tensorflow` is lazy evaluated. The benefit of using Tensorflow over NumPy is that the graph enables mathematical optimizations (e.g. simplifications), gradient calculations via automatic differentiation, compiling the entire graph to C to run at machine speed, and also compiling it to run on a GPU or TPU. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fundamentally, TensorFlow uses [graphs](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/graphs) for computation, wherein the graphs represent computation as dependencies among individual operations. In the programming paradigm for Tensorflow graphs, we first define the dataflow graph, and then create a TensorFlow session to run parts of the graph. A Tensorflow [`tf.Session()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/Session) object runs the graph to get the variables we want to model. In the example below, we are using a global session object `sess`, which we created above in the \"Imports and Global Variables\" section. \n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid the sometimes confusing aspects of lazy evaluation, Tensorflow's eager mode does immediate evaluation of results to give an even more similar feel to working with NumPy. With Tensorflow [eager](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/eager) mode, you can evaluate operations immediately, without explicitly building graphs: operations return concrete values instead of constructing a computational graph to run later. If we're in eager mode, we are presented with tensors that can be converted to numpy array equivalents immediately. Eager mode makes it easy to get started with TensorFlow and debug models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "TFP is essentially:\n",
    "\n",
    "* a collection of tensorflow symbolic expressions for various probability distributions that are combined into one big compute graph, and\n",
    "* a collection of inference algorithms that use that graph to compute probabilities and gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "For practical purposes, what this means is that in order to build certain models we sometimes have to use core Tensorflow. This simple example for Poisson sampling is how we might work with both graph and eager modes:"

    "\n",
    "Let's look into how [`tfp.distributions`](https://www.tensorflow.org/probability/api_docs/python/tfp/distributions) work.\n",
    "\n",
    "TFP uses distribution subclasses to represent *stochastic*, random variables. A variable is stochastic when the following is true: even if you knew all the values of the variable's parameters and components, it would still be random. Included in this category are instances of classes [`Poisson`](https://www.tensorflow.org/probability/api_docs/python/tfp/distributions/Poisson), [`Uniform`](https://www.tensorflow.org/probability/api_docs/python/tfp/distributions/Uniform), and [`Exponential`](https://www.tensorflow.org/probability/api_docs/python/tfp/distributions/Exponential).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can draw random samples from a stochastic variable. When you draw samples, those samples become [`tensorflow.Tensors`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/Tensor) that behave deterministically from that point on. A quick mental check to determine if something is *deterministic* is: *If I knew all of the inputs for creating the variable `foo`, I could calculate the value of `foo`.*  You can add, subtract, and otherwise manipulate the tensors in a variety of ways discussed below. These operations are almost always deterministic.\n"

    "#### Initializing a Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Initializing a stochastic, or random, variable requires a few class-specific parameters that describe the Distribution's shape, such as the location and scale. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "some_distribution = tfd.Uniform(0., 4.)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "initializes a stochastic, or random, [`Uniform`](https://www.tensorflow.org/probability/api_docs/python/tfp/distributions/Uniform) distribution with the lower bound at 0 and upper bound at 4. Calling `sample()` on the distribution returns a tensor that will behave deterministically from that point on:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sampled_tensor = some_distribution.sample()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The next example demonstrates what we mean when we say that distributions are stochastic but tensors are deterministic:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "derived_tensor_1 = 1 + sampled_tensor\n",
    "derived_tensor_2 = 1 + sampled_tensor  # equal to 1\n",
    "\n",
    "derived_tensor_3 = 1 + some_distribution.sample()\n",
    "derived_tensor_4 = 1 + some_distribution.sample()  # different from 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first two lines produce the same value because they refer to the same sampled tensor. The last two lines likely produce different values because they refer to independent samples drawn from the same distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "To define a multiviariate distribution, just pass in arguments with the shape you want the output to be when creating the distribution. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "betas = tfd.Uniform([0., 0.], [1., 1.])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Creates a Distribution with batch_shape (2,). Now, when you call betas.sample(),\n",
    "two values will be returned instead of one. You can read more about TFP shape semantics in the [TFP docs](https://github.com/tensorflow/probability/blob/master/tensorflow_probability/examples/jupyter_notebooks/Understanding_TensorFlow_Distributions_Shapes.ipynb), but most uses in this book should be self-explanatory."

    "## Modeling approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "A good starting thought to Bayesian modeling is to think about *how your data might have been generated*. Position yourself in an omniscient position, and try to imagine how *you* would recreate the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the last chapter we investigated text message data. We begin by asking how our observations may have been generated:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  We started by thinking \"what is the best random variable to describe this count data?\" A Poisson random variable is a good candidate because it can represent count data. So we model the number of sms's received as sampled from a Poisson distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Next, we think, \"Ok, assuming sms's are Poisson-distributed, what do I need for the Poisson distribution?\" Well, the Poisson distribution has a parameter $\\lambda$. \n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Do we know $\\lambda$? No. In fact, we have a suspicion that there are *two* $\\lambda$ values, one for the earlier behaviour and one for the later behaviour. We don't know when the behaviour switches though, but call the switchpoint $\\tau$.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is a good distribution for the two $\\lambda$s? The exponential is good, as it assigns probabilities to positive real numbers. Well the exponential distribution has a parameter too, call it $\\alpha$.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Do we know what the parameter $\\alpha$ might be? No. At this point, we could continue and assign a distribution to $\\alpha$, but it's better to stop once we reach a set level of ignorance: whereas we have a prior belief about $\\lambda$, (\"it probably changes over time\", \"it's likely between 10 and 30\", etc.), we don't really have any strong beliefs about $\\alpha$. So it's best to stop here. \n",
    "\n",
    "    What is a good value for $\\alpha$ then? We think that the $\\lambda$s are between 10-30, so if we set $\\alpha$ really low (which corresponds to larger probability on high values) we are not reflecting our prior well. Similar, a too-high alpha misses our prior belief as well. A good idea for $\\alpha$ as to reflect our belief is to set the value so that the mean of $\\lambda$, given $\\alpha$, is equal to our observed mean. This was shown in the last chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. We have no expert opinion of when $\\tau$ might have occurred. So we will suppose $\\tau$ is from a discrete uniform distribution over the entire timespan.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we give a graphical visualization of this, where arrows denote `parent-child` relationships. (provided by the [Daft Python library](http://daft-pgm.org/) )\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/7J30oCG.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "TFP and other probabilistic programming languages have been designed to tell these data-generation *stories*. More generally, B. Cronin writes [2]:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Probabilistic programming will unlock narrative explanations of data, one of the holy grails of business analytics and the unsung hero of scientific persuasion. People think in terms of stories - thus the unreasonable power of the anecdote to drive decision-making, well-founded or not. But existing analytics largely fails to provide this kind of story; instead, numbers seemingly appear out of thin air, with little of the causal context that humans prefer when weighing their options."

    "### Example: Bayesian A/B testing\n",
    "\n",
    "A/B testing is a statistical design pattern for determining the difference of effectiveness between two different treatments. For example, a pharmaceutical company is interested in the effectiveness of drug A vs drug B. The company will test drug A on some fraction of their trials, and drug B on the other fraction (this fraction is often 1/2, but we will relax this assumption). After performing enough trials, the in-house statisticians sift through the data to determine which drug yielded better results. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, front-end web developers are interested in which design of their website yields more sales or some other metric of interest. They will route some fraction of visitors to site A, and the other fraction to site B, and record if the visit yielded a sale or not. The data is recorded (in real-time), and analyzed afterwards. \n",
    "\n",
    "Often, the post-experiment analysis is done using something called a hypothesis test like *difference of means test* or *difference of proportions test*. This involves often misunderstood quantities like a \"Z-score\" and even more confusing \"p-values\" (please don't ask). If you have taken a statistics course, you have probably been taught this technique (though not necessarily *learned* this technique). And if you were like me, you may have felt uncomfortable with their derivation -- good: the Bayesian approach to this problem is much more natural. \n"

    "### A Simple Case\n",
    "\n",
    "As this is a hacker book, we'll continue with the web-dev example. For the moment, we will focus on the analysis of site A only. Assume that there is some true $0 \\lt p_A \\lt 1$ probability that users who, upon shown site A, eventually purchase from the site. This is the true effectiveness of site A. Currently, this quantity is unknown to us. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose site A was shown to $N$ people, and $n$ people purchased from the site. One might conclude hastily that $p_A = \\frac{n}{N}$. Unfortunately, the *observed frequency* $\\frac{n}{N}$ does not necessarily equal $p_A$ -- there is a difference between the *observed frequency* and the *true frequency* of an event. The true frequency can be interpreted as the probability of an event occurring. For example, the true frequency of rolling a 1 on a 6-sided die is $\\frac{1}{6}$. Knowing the true frequency of events like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- fraction of users who make purchases, \n",
    "- frequency of social attributes, \n",
    "- percent of internet users with cats etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "are common requests we ask of Nature. Unfortunately, often Nature hides the true frequency from us and we must *infer* it from observed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *observed frequency* is then the frequency we observe: say rolling the die 100 times you may observe 20 rolls of 1.

    "The goal of probabilistic inference is to find model parameters that may explain\n",
    "data you have observed. TFP performs probabilistic inference by evaluating the\n",
    "model parameters using a `joint_log_prob` function.  The arguments to `joint_log_prob` are data and model parameters—for the model defined in the `joint_log_prob` function itself. The function returns the log of the joint probability that the model parameterized as such generated the observed data per the input arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "All `joint_log_prob` functions have a common structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The function takes a set of **inputs** to evaluate. Each input is either an\n",
    "observed value or a model parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `joint_log_prob` function uses probability distributions to define a **model** for evaluating the inputs. These distributions measure the likelihood of the input values. (By convention, the distribution that measures the likelihood of the variable `foo` will be named `rv_foo` to note that it is a random variable.) We use two types of distributions in `joint_log_prob` functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "  a. **Prior distributions** measure the likelihood of input values.\n",
    "A prior distribution never depends on an input value each prior distribution measures the\n",
    "likelihood of a single input value. Each unknown variable—one that has not been\n",
    "observed directly—needs a corresponding prior. Beliefs about which values could\n",
    "be reasonable determine the prior distribution. Choosing a prior can be tricky,\n",
    "so we will cover it in depth in Chapter 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "  b. **Conditional distributions** measure the likelihood of an input value given\n",
    "other input values. Typically, the conditional\n",
    "distributions return the likelihood of observed data given the current guess of parameters in the model, p(observed_data | model_parameters).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Finally, we calculate and return the **joint log probability** of the inputs.\n",
    "The joint log probability is the sum of the log probabilities from all of the\n",
    "prior and conditional distributions. (We take the sum of log probabilities\n",
    "instead of multiplying the probabilities directly for reasons of numerical\n",
    "stability: floating point numbers in computers cannot represent the very small\n",
    "values necessary to calculate the joint log probability unless they are in \n",
    "log space.) The sum of probabilities is actually an unnormalized density; although the total sum of probabilities  over all possible inputs might not sum to one, the sum of probabilities is proportional to the true probability density. This proportional distribution is sufficient to estimate the distribution of likely inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's map these terms onto the code above. In this example, the input values\n",
    "are the observed values in `occurrences` and the unknown value for `prob_A`. The `joint_log_prob` takes the current guess for `prob_A`\n",
    "and answers, how likely is the data if `prob_A` is the probability of\n",
    "`occurrences`. The answer depends on two distributions:\n",
    "1. The prior distribution, `rv_prob_A`, indicates how likely the current value of `prob_A` is by itself.\n",
    "2. The conditional distribution, `rv_occurrences`, indicates the likelihood of `occurrences` if `prob_A` were the  probability for the Bernoulli distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sum of the log of these probabilities is the\n",
    "joint log probability. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `joint_log_prob` is particularly useful in conjunction with the [`tfp.mcmc`](https://www.tensorflow.org/probability/api_docs/python/tfp/mcmc)\n",
    "module. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms proceed by making educated guesses about the unknown\n",
    "input values and\n",
    "computing what the likelihood of this set of arguments is. (We’ll talk about how it makes those guesses in Chapter 3.) By repeating this process\n",
    "many times, MCMC builds a distribution of likely parameters. Constructing this\n",
    "distribution is the goal of probabilistic inference."

Like the Poisson distribution, it is a discrete distribution, but unlike the Poisson distribution, it only weighs integers from $0$ to $N$. The mass distribution looks like:\n",

The larger $p$ is (while still remaining between 0 and 1), the more events are likely to occur. The expected value of a binomial is equal to $Np$.

    "\n",
    "> In the interview process for each student, the student flips a coin, hidden from the interviewer. The student agrees to answer honestly if the coin comes up heads. Otherwise, if the coin comes up tails, the student (secretly) flips the coin again, and answers \"Yes, I did cheat\" if the coin flip lands heads, and \"No, I did not cheat\", if the coin flip lands tails. This way, the interviewer does not know if a \"Yes\" was the result of a guilty plea, or a Heads on a second coin toss. Thus privacy is preserved and the researchers receive honest answers. \n",

    "I call this the Privacy Algorithm. One could of course argue that the interviewers are still receiving false data since some *Yes*'s are not confessions but instead randomness, but an alternative perspective is that the researchers are discarding approximately half of their original dataset since half of the responses will be noise. But they have gained a systematic data generation process that can be modeled. Furthermore, they do not have to incorporate (perhaps somewhat naively) the possibility of deceitful answers. We can use TFP to dig through this noisy model, and find a posterior distribution for the true frequency of liars. "

    "On January 28, 1986, the twenty-fifth flight of the U.S. space shuttle program ended in disaster when one of the rocket boosters of the Shuttle Challenger exploded shortly after lift-off, killing all seven crew members. The presidential commission on the accident concluded that it was caused by the failure of an O-ring in a field joint on the rocket booster, and that this failure was due to a faulty design that made the O-ring unacceptably sensitive to a number of factors including outside temperature. Of the previous 24 flights, data were available on failures of O-rings on 23, (one was lost at sea), and these data were discussed on the evening preceding the Challenger launch, but unfortunately only the data corresponding to the 7 flights on which there was a damage incident were considered important and these were thought to show no obvious trend. The data are shown below (see [1]):\n",

The reason for this is that if `beta` and `alpha` are very large, they make `p` equal to 1 or 0. Unfortunately, `tfd.Bernoulli` does not like probabilities of exactly 0 or 1, though they are mathematically well-defined probabilities. So by setting the coefficient values to `0`, we set the variable `p` to be a reasonable starting value. This has no effect on our results, nor does it mean we are including any additional information in our prior. It is simply a computational caveat in TFP. "

Similarly, when reporting to scientists your estimates, you should be very cautious about simply telling them the expected probability, as we can see this does not reflect how *wide* the posterior distribution is."

    "The skeptical reader will say \"You deliberately chose the logistic function for $p(t)$ and the specific priors. Perhaps other functions or priors will give different results. How do I know I have chosen a good model?\" This is absolutely true. To consider an extreme situation, what if I had chosen the function $p(t) = 1,\\; \\forall t$, which guarantees a defect always occurring: I would have again predicted disaster on January 28th. Yet this is clearly a poorly chosen model. On the other hand, if I did choose the logistic function for $p(t)$, but specified all my priors to be very tight around 0, likely we would have very different posterior distributions. How do we know our model is an expression of the data? This encourages us to measure the model's **goodness of fit**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think: *how can we test whether our model is a bad fit?* An idea is to compare observed data with artificial dataset which we can simulate. The rationale is that if the simulated dataset does not appear similar, statistically, to the observed dataset, then likely our model is not accurately represented the observed data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Previously in this Chapter, we simulated an artificial dataset for the SMS example. To do this, we sampled values from the priors. We saw how varied the resulting datasets looked like, and rarely did they mimic our observed dataset. In the current example,  we should sample from the *posterior* distributions to create *very plausible datasets*. Luckily, our Bayesian framework makes this very easy. We only need to gather samples from the distribution of choice, and specify the number of samples, the shape of the samples (we had 21 observations in our original dataset, so we'll make the shape of each sample 21), and the probability we want to use to determine the ratio of 1 observations to 0 observations.\n",
